# Double Gold Star

# Khayyam Triangle

# The French mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who built a mechanical computer in
# the 17th century, studied a pattern of numbers now commonly known in parts of
# the world as Pascal's Triangle (it was also previously studied by many Indian,
# Chinese, and Persian mathematicians, and is known by different names in other
# parts of the world).

# The pattern is shown below:

#                    1
#                   1 1
#                  1 2 1
#                 1 3 3 1
#                1 4 6 4 1
#                   ...

# Each number is the sum of the number above it to the left and the number above
# it to the right (any missing numbers are counted as 0).

# Define a procedure, triangle(n), that takes a number n as its input, and
# returns a list of the first n rows in the triangle. Each element of the
# returned list should be a list of the numbers at the corresponding row in the
# triangle.

def factorial(n):
    return 1 if (n<2) else n * factorial(n-1)

def binomialCoefficient(n, r):
    return factorial(n)/(factorial(r) * factorial(n-r))

def triangle(n):
    triangle = []
    for rowNumber in range(n):
        row = [binomialCoefficient(rowNumber, a_n_r) for a_n_r in range(rowNumber+1)]
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle

#For example:

print triangle(0)
#>>> []

print triangle(1)
#>>> [[1]]

print triangle(2)
#>> [[1], [1, 1]]

print triangle(3)
#>>> [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]]

print triangle(6)
#>>> [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1], [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]]
